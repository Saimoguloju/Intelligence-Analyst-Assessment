# Intelligence Analyst Assessment
### **Data Provided**

1. **Geospatial Data**: A dataset containing GPS coordinates, timestamps, locations, and
movement types (entry/exit) for the past 6 months.
2. **Satellite Details**: A set of satellite details covering key areas along the border
between Country A and Country B.
3. **News Reports**: A collection of recent news articles and social media posts related to
cross-border incidents.
4. **Historical Incidents** **Database**: A summary of past border incidents, including dates,
locations, and outcomes.
### **Tasks**

1. **Geospatial Analysis (30 points)**
    - **Task**: Analyze the geospatial data to identify areas with significant cross-border
    movements. Use geospatial analysis tools (e.g., GIS software) to create heat maps and
    identify hotspots
    - **Deliverable**: Make a slide summarizing your findings, including visualizations of
    movement patterns and any identified hotspots. Discuss any anomalies or unusual
    patterns that may indicate potential threats.
2. **Satellite Details Interpretation (20 points)**
    - **Task**: Review the provided satellite details and identify any changes or activities that
    could be related to cross-border movements. Focus on identifying new infrastructure,
    troop deployments, or other significant changes.
    - **Deliverable**: Make a Slide based on your analysis**.**
3. **Correlation with Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) (20 points)**
    - **Task**: Cross-reference the geospatial data and satellite imagery findings with the
    provided news reports and social media posts. Identify any corroborating evidence or
    discrepancies.
    - **Deliverable**: Make a slide and provide a summary of your analysis, highlighting any
    correlations between the data and the OSINT. Discuss how this information could
    impact your assessment of the situation.
4. **Threat Assessment and Recommendations (20 points)**
    - **Task**: Based on your analysis, assess the potential threats posed by the identified
    cross-border movements. Consider the historical incidents and any emerging patterns.
    - **Deliverable**: Make a slide based on your threat assessment, including
    recommendations for further monitoring, intelligence gathering, or other actions that
    should be taken by the intelligence team.
5. **Presentation of Findings (10 points)**
    - **Task**: Prepare a presentation summarizing your key findings, including separate
    slides for each task assigned above with visualizations, and recommendations.
    Imagine you are presenting this to senior intelligence officials who may not be
    familiar with the data but need to understand the implications and the presentation (or
    similar format) should clearly communicate your analysis and recommendations.
    Focus on clarity, conciseness, and the ability to convey complex information in an
    understandable manner.
